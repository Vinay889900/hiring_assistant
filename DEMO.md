### Phase 4: Dynamic Technical Question Generation

Once the tech stack is submitted, the application demonstrates its most sophisticated feature:

#### LLM Integration Process
- The system constructs a carefully crafted prompt including the candidate's tech stack
- The prompt is sent to the OpenAI API for processing
- The LLM generates 3-5 relevant technical questions based on the declared technologies
- Questions are parsed and formatted for presentation

#### Question Quality and Relevance
The generated questions demonstrate several key characteristics:
- **Technology-Specific**: Questions directly relate to the technologies mentioned
- **Appropriately Challenging**: Questions assess fundamental understanding without being overly complex
- **Practical Focus**: Questions often relate to real-world application scenarios
- **Varied Difficulty**: Questions may range from basic concepts to more advanced applications

#### Example Generated Questions
For a candidate with "Python, Django, React" tech stack, the system might generate:
1. "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python and when you would use each."
2. "How does Django's MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture work, and how does it differ from MVC?"
3. "What are React hooks, and how do they improve upon class-based components?"
4. "Describe how you would handle database migrations in a Django project."
5. "Explain the concept of virtual DOM in React and its performance benefits."

### Phase 5: Technical Response Collection

The application provides a structured interface for collecting responses:

#### Response Interface Design
- Individual text areas are created for each generated question
- Questions are clearly numbered and displayed above each response area
- The interface allows for detailed, multi-paragraph responses
- Validation ensures that all questions receive responses before proceeding

#### Response Quality Indicators
The system encourages comprehensive responses by:
- Providing ample space for detailed explanations
- Allowing candidates to include code examples or technical details
- Supporting various response formats including bullet points and structured explanations

### Phase 6: Conversation Conclusion

The final phase demonstrates professional conversation management:

#### Graceful Termination
- A thank you message acknowledges the candidate's time and effort
- Information about next steps is provided to set appropriate expectations
- The conversation history remains visible for review

#### Data Persistence
- All collected information is automatically saved to a JSON file
- The file includes personal information, tech stack, generated questions, and responses
- Data is organized in a clear, structured format for easy review by recruitment staff

## Data Storage Demonstration

### File Structure
The application creates a `candidate_data` directory containing individual JSON files for each candidate. Each file follows the naming convention: `[Candidate_Name].json`

### Data Format Example
```json
{
    "candidate_info": {
        "full_name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@email.com",
        "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
        "experience": "5 years",
        "position": "Full Stack Developer",
        "location": "San Francisco, CA",
        "tech_stack": ["Python", "Django", "React", "PostgreSQL"]
    },
    "tech_questions": [
        "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python...",
        "How does Django's MTV architecture work...",
        "What are React hooks and how do they improve..."
    ],
    "conversation": [
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm your Hiring Assistant..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "My name is John Doe"},
        // ... complete conversation history
    ]
}
```
